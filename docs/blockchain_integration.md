## Implementation Details

1. **Transaction Initiation**:
   - The API accepts transaction requests with user and data payloads.
   - Validates inputs using schemas.

2. **Blockchain Service**:
   - Uses Solana SDK to connect to the blockchain.
   - Signs and submits transactions.

3. **Security**:
   - Implements cryptographic signing to ensure integrity.
   - Verifies transaction status via Solanaâ€™s API.

## Best Practices

- Always validate transaction inputs.
- Ensure that private keys and secrets are securely stored.
- Use Solana testnet for development to avoid unnecessary fees.
