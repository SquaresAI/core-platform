# User Management

## Overview
The `core-platform` includes a robust user management system that supports authentication, registration, and user data management. This document explains its features and implementation details.

---

## Features

- **Authentication**: OAuth2 with JWT tokens.
- **Role Management**: Define user roles (e.g., admin, user).
- **Password Encryption**: Uses bcrypt for secure password storage.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle high user volumes.

---

## Data Model

- **User**:
  - `id`: Unique identifier.
  - `username`: Unique username.
  - `email`: User email.
  - `hashed_password`: Encrypted password.
  - `role`: User role.

---

## API Endpoints

1. **Register User**:
   - Endpoint: `/auth/register`
   - Validates user data and encrypts passwords.

2. **Login User**:
   - Endpoint: `/auth/login`
   - Verifies credentials and issues a JWT token.

3. **Fetch Users**:
   - Endpoint: `/users/`
   - Requires admin role for access.

## Security Considerations

- Implement rate limiting on login endpoints to prevent brute force attacks.
- Use HTTPS to encrypt all communications.
- Rotate JWT secret keys periodically.
