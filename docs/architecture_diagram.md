# Architecture Diagram

## Overview
This document describes the architecture of the `core-platform` project. The platform is designed to support AI workflows, blockchain integration, and robust user management. It uses a modular and scalable architecture to ensure maintainability and performance.

---

## High-Level Architecture

- **Backend Framework**: Python with FastAPI for high-performance API handling.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for reliable and scalable data storage.
- **AI Workflow Management**: Integrated services for AI model training, deployment, and evaluation.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Utilizes Solana for secure and efficient decentralized transactions.
- **Authentication**: Implements OAuth2 with JWT tokens.
- **Containerization**: Dockerized services for deployment consistency.

## Modular Breakdown

1. **App Layer**:
   - Routers: Define API endpoints for specific domains (e.g., auth, user management).
   - Models: Represent the data schema and structure.
   - Services: Implement business logic (e.g., user authentication, blockchain interactions).

2. **Config Layer**:
   - Environment-specific configurations for development, production, and testing.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Comprehensive guides for API usage and architectural decisions.

4. **Database Migrations**:
   - Alembic for versioned schema changes.

## Scalability Considerations

- Horizontal scaling via container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes).
- Modular services to enable independent scaling of specific features.
- Integration of Solanaâ€™s lightweight protocol for blockchain scalability.
